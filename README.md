# AI-DevOps-Project

This project is a hands-on exploration of building secure, scalable, cost-aware infrastructure for AI-native tools using modern DevOps practices.

Instead of treating AI apps like demos, this project treats them like production-grade software â€” complete with CI/CD, containerization, secrets management, and token-level cost tracking.
